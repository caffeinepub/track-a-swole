  "summary": "The implementation substantially fulfills the BuildRequest. All major requirements appear to be addressed: a Login component was created, Layout conditionally renders based on authentication, a logout button was added, backend data structures were modified to store exercises and sessions per-user using Principal IDs, backend methods now scope data by caller Principal, and frontend query hooks check authentication state. The diff shows comprehensive changes to backend and frontend files. However, some evidence is limited due to truncation.",
