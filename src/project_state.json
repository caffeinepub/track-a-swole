Features include a custom exercise library where users can create exercise templates with default values for 3 sets (weight, reps, and comments per set), workout sessions where users select exercises from the library and edit the pre-populated values as they perform them, a 'done' button to add completed exercises to the session history, and workout history to view past sessions. Dark theme with modern design.",

    "Workout sessions should store date, name, and array of exercises with set/weight/rep data",
    "Each exercise in a session has exactly 3 sets (fixed), but weight and reps are adjustable per set",
    "Exercise library templates should store: exercise name, and for each of 3 sets: default weight, default reps, and default comments",
    "Workout session flow: select exercise from library → defaults pre-populate → user edits actual values → click 'done' → adds to session history"
