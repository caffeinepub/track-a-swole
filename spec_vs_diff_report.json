  "summary": "The diff implements fixes across useQueries.ts, ExerciseLibrary.tsx, and AddExerciseForm.tsx that address all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed by adding proper loading state logic and error display in ExerciseLibrary.tsx. REQ-2 is addressed by decoupling the Add Exercise button from DialogTrigger and using a manual onClick handler. REQ-3 is addressed by adding actor guard checks, enabled flags, placeholderData, and try/catch error handling in useQueries.ts. All requirements appear to be implemented.",
